## Place a QR code
In order to have to contents of the scene in a reasonable space in your laboratory, you need to place a QR code on one of the walls.
We recommend a QR code printed on a at least DIN A4 sized paper.
To save you some hassle to find or create your own QR code, you can <a href="/qr_dina4.pdf" target="_blank">download this one here</a>.
A good position for such a QR code is an open spot at your wall at standing height that is easy to access or get close to.

## Scanning
In case of an in-person scenario where all collaborators are in the same laboratory, each device has to scan the QR code before connecting to the server.
Start chARp and select **Scan QR** in the login screen.
Look at the QR code on the wall, you will see a white plane over the code and an axis system on the corner of the plane with a z-axis pointing away from the wall.
Usually, the z-axis wiggles a little bit because of scanning inaccuracy.
Look at the code from different angles and distances and press the button **Stop Scan** that should follow you around when the wiggle is least noticeable.

In case of a remote collaboration, a similar placement of QR codes is recommended to reflect the scene correctly.
If, for example, one client puts the code on the wall and the other puts the code on the ground,
any interaction with the scene results in movements in the wrong direction.
The same is true for a differently oriented QR code.
We recommend placing the QR code with the three large squares on the left bottom, left top and right top.
